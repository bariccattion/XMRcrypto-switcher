# XMRcrypto-switcher
Just a ugly scrypt made quickly to autoswitch mining to the most profitable coin, to use with XMR-STAK.

##### USAGE:

Extract all files to XMR-STAK root folder.

You need to have a "poolsCOINTICKER.txt" for each coin you which to mine, example: "poolsMSR.txt" 

Right now this supports:

XMR KRB TRTL XUN IPBC SUMO DCY MSR GRFT ITNS XLC ETN
