# XMRcrypto-switcher
Just a ugly scrypt made quickly to autoswitch mining to the most profitable coin, to use with XMR-STAK.

USAGE:
You need a Hashmonitor to use alongside, I recommend JJs_HashMonitor or Precious Guardian.
Make sure to include "-c monero-config.txt" in your XMR-STAK start.bat
You need to have a "monero-configCOINTICKER.txt" for each coin you which to mine, right now this supports:
KRB TRTL XUN IPBC SUMO DCY MSR GRFT ITNS XLC ETN
